- The folder contains a 4-pages .pdf report and the src directory with the 8 Java classes : Manager, MyLogger, PageExploration, PageParser, WookiePage, Tree and TreeException.

- The main class (ie the one you have to run) is Manager. You could change the following parameters in the main class : 
	- USEPROXY : true if you use a proxy (will only work with the proxy of the Ecole polytechnique, for example for the computers in the informatic room)
	- DEPTH : the maximum search depth 
	- ROOT_URL : if you would like to start the search from another character, you have to type the adress of the Wookiepedia page about this character (in English)
	- PRINTMOREINFORMATIONS : True if you would like some more informations (for example the number of characters found by the program, the number of request failures) 
	- MAXIMAL : the maximum number of threads working together 
	
- Before running the program if you're using Eclipse, do not forget to build a path to the Jsoup library.
